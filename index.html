                      <p>The Beatles continue to be an influential band that has endured the test of time.
                          Their music has spanned many genres - from rock and roll, blues, folk, country, reggae, avant-garde, hard rock, music hall, and psychedelic music -
                          that has appealed to generations of listeners into modern day.

                          <br><br>By judging an album by its cover, it is possible to get a glimpse into the tone of the band's songwriting and growth through the decade.

                          <br><br>The most notable shift was from Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band with the intensity and vibrancy of a psychedelic palette to the
                          clean slate of the White Album.  This shift is also mirrored in the songs and their instrumental qualities.  For example, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
                          had heavy studio effects and a done provided by unique instrumentals like an Indian tambura. Blackbird, on the other hand, was heavily acoustic and lyrical, written and performed solo by Paul McCartney.

                  <h2>The Albums of Each Era</h2>
                  <h3>What album captures their artistic legacy most?  What can we understand about the band's evolution throughout their work throughout the decade?</h3>
                    <p>
                    The Beatles were at the pinnacle of popular success when they recorded Abbey Road and the White Album.
                    As seen here, their most popular songs to date (Here Comes the Sun and Come Together) were written in 1968 and 1969.

                    <br><br>The White Album was written as the band had left a meditation retreat, where tensions had mounted amongst the artists (in
                    particular, due to John Lennon's relationship with Yoko Ono).  In later reflection, John noted these rifts may have been a preview of the band's break up in the coming years.

                    <br><br>The tracks on these albums were indeed more varied as each of the band members asserted more of their individual preferences and artistic voice, which resulted
                    in a collection of more distinct songs contained in the largest album to date.  In a departure from their prior practice of mixing multiple genres into a single track,
                    they instead stayed with a single genre or style per track in the White Album.
